# Ordinary Differential Equations modeling for cofactor binding

### Project Overview
Objective: Model incorporation of the FeGP cofactor into the hydrgenase and it's catalytic capabilities.

Context: Fe-hydrogenase is the third type of hydrogenase which requires a co-factor, the FeGP cofactor. The kinetics of incorporation, activation and catalysis aren't yet fully understood. This work was done as part of the following work: ![Crystal Structures of [Fe]-Hydrogenase from Methanolacinia paynteri Suggest a Path of the FeGP-Cofactor Incorporation Process](https://doi.org/10.3390/inorganics8090050)

Significance: Understanding cofactor binding and enzyme activation kinetics is an ongoing problem in biochemistry, with various approaches being developed. Mathematical modeling and computational simulation are one of this approaches, here applied for the first time to the anaerobic Fe-hyrogenase.

Goal: Determine if observed kinetics can be explained through a mathematical model which furthers expands the reconsitution hypotfesis.
